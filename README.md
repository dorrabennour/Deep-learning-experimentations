# Deep-learning-experimentations
The objective of the different Tps implemented throughout the deep learning sessions is to understand and implement the different deep learning algorithms encountered in the course. These algorithms include the different architectures of deep convolutional networks, manifold untagging, hyperparameter optimization, transfer learning and finally recurrent neural networks.
